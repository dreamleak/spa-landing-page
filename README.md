## diving deeper into adaptive design 

While somewhat tedious, flexbox is very useful and convenient for layout composition. I'm elated how The Odin Project introduced a new section designated to Flexbox, as manipulating element positioning on a webpage has personally not been my strong suit, and thus what better way to tackle the problem more in-depth this time around? 

I can definitely notice steady improvement in how differently I approach the properties for both flex containers and their flex items. After extensive research, I have taken note of certain patterns surround how flexbox behaves accordingly to the fluid behaviour flow of space distribution along the main and cross axis.
